    <p class="intro"><i>Hello everyone!</i> 
        My name is Julia Guo. I am a senior at Magee Secondary School hailing from Vancouver, BC. I will start with a brief introduction. Some of my favourite pastimes are coding, reading, and writing. I love listening to music and doing pilates. I am passionate about an array of different things, including advocating for girls in computer science! On this website, you will find more information about the apps I have programmed and the research I have done. Feel free to email me at 
       <span class="thin-highlight-white"><i>juliagsquash@gmail.com</i> for any collaboration possibilities, opportunities, or other inquiries!</span></a> <img class="descriptive-icon"

            <p class="proj-text">The name Procation is a mix between&apos;protection &apos;and  &apos;location.&apos; </p>

            </p> The idea for Procation was sparked by the profound sense of injustice that arose while I 
                read numerous articles regarding violence against women and children. Over the span of two years, 
                I have devoted myself to refining the project, achieving notable milestones, including securing first 
                place in the globally recognized Technovation Girls competition. Currently available on the Android app 
                store, Procation has already begun to make an impact within my local community. However, my goal is to 
                broaden its influence by encompassing diverse communities and garnering greater exposure to generate a more 
                substantial and enduring impact. Thus, if you have any ideas, feedback, propositions, please contact me

                    </p> Divvynotes is the product of a collaboration between 3 highschoolers (including myself). We all came from different backgrounds, yet still were able to realize that many students lacked educational resources. As advocates for educational accessibility, we wanted to create a service that allowed generous students to share the notes that they take in school or other extracurricular programs. Anybody is allowed to create an account. However, we target unfortunate kids or troubled youth who can't easily access educational resources.</p>

            </p> Judging from its name, you can already tell it is going to be a news app. However, what is unique about this app is that I intend for it to be targeted towards the Vancouver niche. There, you will find various topics such as foods to try and places to visit. Additionally, users will be able to create their own accounts and post contributions on topics they believe are relevant. With these accounts, users can interconnect and communicate with one another. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed programming it!

            <p class="proj-text">Given description: </p>
        </p> The speaker, Julia, begins by acknowledging the universal desire for better relationships within a family,
                 focusing on their relationship with an older sister, Vivian. She recounts the struggles of growing up with
                  her sister, highlighting the envy and difficulties that arose as Vivian entered high school and gained 
                  new privileges. She describes a sense of disconnection and ongoing conflict that led to feelings of failure
                   in not achieving a healthy relationship with her sister, something she saw as fundamental to success. The
                    portrayal of solidarity in movies and the relationships of friends and relatives only intensified these 
                    feelings. During the COVID-19 quarantine, Julia and her sister began to reconnect by watching movies 
                    together and sharing hobbies. They communicated, apologized, and set aside differences, eventually 
                    rebuilding a strong and meaningful relationship. Julia expresses gratitude for this newfound success 
                    in bonding. She broadens the concept of success, defining it as versatile and achievable in many ways. 
                    Julia leaves the audience with a heartfelt and inspiring message about the key to success and how it has 
                    shaped her into a goal-oriented and passionate individual. Her personal story of reconciliation with her 
                    sister serves as a vivid illustration of her belief that success is a nuanced and highly personal concept 
                    that can be found in unexpected places. Julia Guo, a grade 11 student at Magee Secondary School. Julia 
                    cannot wait to watch the TedxYouth event play out in June and the various ways that success will be presented. 
                    Having been at this school since grade 8 and seeing it progress through the many years, Julia believes that Magee 
                    offers the perfect environment for such an event. From the welcoming people to the kind, understanding teachers, 
                    it is the Magee community Julia values. Currently, she contributes to the school environment through running the 
                    school magazine in order to share student and teacher voices, hoping to create a closer knit community.</p>
